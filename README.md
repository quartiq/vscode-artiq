# ARTIQ for Visual Studio Code

[The VS Code ARTIQ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quartiq.artiq)
provides rich UI for the
[ARTIQ control system for quantum information experiments](https://github.com/m-labs/artiq).

## Requirements

*   Visual Studio Code 1.98 or newer
*   ARTIQ: HEAD of the `master` branch (what becomes `release-9` one day).
    Clone directly from the [repository](https://github.com/m-labs/artiq), e.g.:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/m-labs/artiq
    cd artiq
    nix run # obtain nix via https://nix.dev/install-nix#install-nix
    cd path/to/my/experiments
    artiq_master

## Quick Start

Welcome! 👋🏻<br/>
Whether you are new to ARTIQ or an experienced ARTIQ user, we hope this
extension fits your needs and enhances your working experience.

1.  Install [ARTIQ](https://github.com/m-labs/artiq) if you haven't already.

1.  Install the [VS Code ARTIQ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quartiq.artiq).

1.  Access the extension via Primary Sidebar and Panel. Select available
    experiments through the ARTIQ Explorer and they will pop-up in the Editor.

1.  The extension depends on `ms-python.python`. If `ms-python.python` is
    missing, the extension will try to install it.

You are ready to go :-) &nbsp;&nbsp; 🎉🎉🎉

⚠️ **Note:** The extension expects to be run alongside `artiq_master` in the
same filesystem tree.
